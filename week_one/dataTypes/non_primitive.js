/**
 Not-primitive data type are more complex , because thay are mutable , mean you can
 change it after it create.

 *
 *?  Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types:
 1. Mutable: the content of varible can be changed whithout changinh the reference to that variable
2. Store by reference: When you assign a non primitive value like array to a variable,
then what gets store in the variable is not the actual data but a reference to that variable.
3. Interdependent: If you copy a non-primitive type variable into another variable,
both variables will point to the same object in memory. Changing the
content of the object through one variable will affect the other.

// ? Example of non primitive data type:
/*
1. Object 
2. Array
3. Function
